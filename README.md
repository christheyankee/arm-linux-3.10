# arm-linux-3.10 Dockerfile
I find myself writing this Dockerfile over and over again so I decided to throw it up here.
## Steps To Compile
I'm going to assume you have `git`, `pip` and `docker` here.
### Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/christheyankee/arm-linux-3.10.git
pip install scuba
```
